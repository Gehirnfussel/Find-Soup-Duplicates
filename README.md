Find-Soup-Duplicates
====================

When I download images from my soup I came across some files that had been downloaded twice or more.

So I had files like:

- 0054_24af_500.jpeg
- 0054_24af_720.jpeg

(The Last 3 digits are the width of that image.)

I deleted so many files by hand… but with about 35000 pics that was just… awful.
So I wrote this little script to help me find duplicates and deletes them (bases on resolution (not filesize)).
